# Dark Mode UI
World of Warcraft AddOn
Dark Mode for Default Blizzard UI

Every frame border and background was changed to dark version.

### Important
If you want complete dark version you need to download DarkModeUI Texture Pack and place it into "World Of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\". Not into AddOns folder, its not an addon. After that you need to restart your game, /reload is not enough.

Texture Pack: https://github.com/NykoPowered/Dark-Mode-UI-Texture-Pack or https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26280-DarkModeUITexturePack.html#info
